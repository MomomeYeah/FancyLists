FancyLists

This is mostly a learning experience to learn Django but also to solve that problem of having to write shopping lists in plain text...the horror!

TODO:

- Users
  - add created_by user to ListCategory (is this the only place it's needed?)
  - set created_by user when creating ListCategory
  - filter displayed information based on current user
  - register new user
- Validation
- Duplicate a new list from a previous one
- AJAX this bitch up
- Make things look nice
