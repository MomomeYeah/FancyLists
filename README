FancyLists

This is mostly a learning experience to learn Django but also to solve that problem of having to write shopping lists in plain text...the horror!

TODO:

- Validation
- Users
- Duplicate a new list from a previous one
- Reorder items within a category
  - in model, define method returning sorted list
  - in template, use sorted_list rather than category_set etc
- Reorder categories within a list
- Make things look nice
