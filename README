FancyLists

This is mostly a learning experience to learn Django but also to solve that problem of having to write shopping lists in plain text...the horror!

TODO:

- Validation
- Users
- Duplicate a new list from a previous one
- Reorder items within a category
- Reorder categories within a list
- Everything should flow and reorder when something is deleted
- Make things look nice
