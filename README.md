FancyLists
==========

This is mostly a learning experience to learn Django but also to solve that problem of having to write shopping lists in plain text...the horror!

TODO
----

* Better validation
* Make things look nice
* Deletes happen in modal dialogues?
* Combine new/edit templates
* Save user settings, i.e. which categories are expanded/collapsed, which list was last being edited, etc.
