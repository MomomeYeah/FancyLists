FancyLists
==========

This is mostly a learning experience to learn Django but also to solve that problem of having to write shopping lists in plain text...the horror!

TODO
----

* Deletes happen in modal dialogues?
* Combine new/edit templates
* Save user settings, i.e. which categories are expanded/collapsed, which list was last being edited, etc.
* Item/Category/List index screens look uneven and bad on small screens - links underneath title?
* Create items against categories, on index add item check item category matches
